### 🎉 Major Features Added
- **Complete BNS Payment Integration** - Production-ready workflow for Beli Nota Segar (BNS) transactions
- **Payment Navigation Workflow** - Automated payment input after transaction completion
- **BNS vs BNB Differentiation** - Separate workflow handling for different transaction types

### 🔧 Technical Improvements
- **Fixed BNS Navigation Logic** - Correct Enter press count after rate input
- **Enhanced AHK Generator** - Updated to handle BNS payment data (`pembayaranRp`)
- **Payment Calculation Fallback** - Automatic calculation from transaction data if payment not provided
- **Conditional Navigation** - Different timing and navigation for BNS vs BNB transactions

### 🚀 BNS Payment Workflow
1. **Transaction Input** - Standard currency, amount, rate input
2. **Navigation to Payment** - Down arrow 1x → Enter 1x
3. **Payment Input** - Automatic payment value input
4. **Completion** - Enter 3x → 1 second delay → Reset with R
5. **Return to Main Menu** - Ready for next transaction

### 🛠️ Bug Fixes
- Removed extra Enter presses in BNS completion flow

### 🔄 Migration Notes

- All navigation flows backward compatible

### 📚 Documentation
